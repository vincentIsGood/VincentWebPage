MISTAKE: Reduce large scale animations (no fancy timeline)
DO: use tabs, maybe

Collapse timeline (don't show it out, too long)
Collapse old personal sites (but do add a way to take a look back in my old personal websites)

Better intro.
With drawings & gpt responses-like design
Change between drawings and the responses by timeout or whatever.

Overall, I want better presentation:
1. Small box (eg. icon) expand to details
2. Add media (eg. screenshot of works, make it like news: https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news)
3. Better design of titles?

To be determined.
